# MidsegmentProblemWebsite

The repo uses Firebase's "Cloud Firestore" and Desmos to create a UI for my old Midsegment Problem repo.

To use it you will need to setup Firebase hosting and Firebase "Cloud Firestore" and put the files from this repo in the /public directory. You will also need to get an API key for Desmos.
